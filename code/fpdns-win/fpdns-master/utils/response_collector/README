To compile:
- Download and install GCC if you don't already have it [http://gcc.gnu.org/]
- Download and install libvdns from http://www.vantage-points.org/download.html.
- Follow the instructions on http://www.vantage-points.org/libvdns.html
- Run ./compile to compile response collector

To run:
./response_collector "$DNS_SERVER_NAME" $SERVER_IP_ADDRESS

or

./response_collector "$VENDOR | $PRODUCT | $VERSION" $SERVER_IP_ADDRESS

or

./response_collector --show-queries

To create  output for use with Fingerprint Generator:
- Redirect collector output to files with .fpr as the extension into a directory
- Run ./response_collector --show-queries and redirect the output to a text file

e.g
./response_collector "Google | DNS | " 8.8.8.8 > GoogleDNS.fpr
./response_collector "ISC | BIND | 10" 192.168.2.5 > BIND10.fpr
./response_collector "EagleDNS" 127.0.0.1 > EagleDNS.fpr
...
./response_collector --show-queries > queries_v0.1.txt
